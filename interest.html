<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Playing Chess</h1></b></u>
One of the things I do to fill my free time is playing chess. Why chess? My father first taught me the game just for fun. He is a very good player, so good that none of my siblings could beat him.Back then, when we didn’t have many gadgets, my siblings and I would play chess with each other to see who was the best. Who would have thought that this simple game could bring me to many tournaments? I have won several awards and represented my school in different competitions. The same goes for my siblings. Chess has become like a family tradition that we continue until today.For me, chess is very special because it is the only game I’m really good at. Until now, I still learn new tactics and sharpen my strategies so I can beat my siblings. <p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Read Book</h1></b></u>
My interest in reading books that provide knowledge comes from my mother. She always reads books related to science, history, and self-development. So, I ended up liking the same genre because I followed what she usually bought. In my collection, there are no fiction or romance novels. If my friends want to borrow books on knowledge or reference materials, they will come to me because they know I have them..<p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #522546; font-size: 200%"><center><b>MY FAVOURITE FOOD</h1></center></b></u>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Nasi Ayam</h1></b></u>
I really prefer traditional village food over Western food. For me, kampung dishes are more filling and more satisfying to eat. One of my favourite kampung dishes is pecal ikan pari. Believe it or not, this dish is very rare. I’ve never seen it sold anywhere. That’s why it feels special to me, because only my mother cooks it. I always help her by grilling the stingray. And once it’s ready, the dish never lasts long, we finish it quickly every time!<p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Nasi Pattaya</h1></b></u>
This second dish can be found almost everywhere, and it’s very popular in my father’s hometown, Parit Buntar. But honestly, no one can beat the taste and texture when my father is the one who cooks it. Kari ikan sembilang (catfish curry) is the dish he’s really good at. The spices, the heat, everything is just perfect. His friends always praise his cooking. My father once opened a Kari Ikan Sembilang stall in our housing area, but sadly, it didn’t last long because most people there didn’t really enjoy that kind of dish. But I truly believe that if he opened the same stall in his hometown, Parit Buntar, it would become a big hit.<p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Nasi Ayam Merah</h1></b></u>
This dish can be called one of my favourite foods, but I rarely get to eat it. Sup belut (eel soup) is a traditional Kelantanese dish, and Kelantan was where I used to live when I was a child. My family and I have beautiful memories of eating this soup together. The pieces of eel would be shared equally among everyone, and I used to save mine for last because I didn’t want to eat it too quickly(I loved it that much). Now that I no longer live there, I miss this dish a lot and often crave it.<p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #522546; font-size: 200%"><center><b>MY FAVOURITE MOVIE</h1></center></b></u>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Stand By Me Doraemon</h1></b></u>
I am the biggest fan of Doraemon. I first got to know this cartoon when it used to air on TV7 at 7 p.m. That’s where it all started, and the memories still feel fresh in my heart. Even now, I still watch Doraemon while eating, usually through YouTube. Watching this cartoon gives me comfort and brings back the joy of my childhood. When the movie Stand By Me Doraemon was released, I was so excited to watch it. Even though I’ve watched it many times, the storyline still feels interesting, and I never get bored of it.<p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Stand By Me Doraemon</h1></b></u>
Frozen was the first princess movie I ever watched. To be honest, I was never a fan of princess stories because I found them boring, and I didn’t like the love stories in them. At first, I wasn’t interested in Frozen at all. I still remember how I got to know this movie. One day, my father bought a CD from the night market. He probably thought it would be a nice movie for the whole family to watch together. Who would have thought that this movie would leave such a big impact on me? The songs and storyline were really good. Since then, I’ve been a fan and always look forward to the next Frozen movie.<p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #522546; font-size: 200%"><center><b>MY FAVOURITE SONG</h1></center></b></u>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Harum Subur Di Hati</h1></b></u>
Harum Subur Di Hati is an old romantic song that is still well-known today. It has become one of my favourite songs because my father is a big fan of sentimental music. Every time we got in the car, he would sing the same song over and over again. In our old house, my father had a huge collection of cassette tapes. This song reminds me of my childhood and all the beautiful memories I had with my father.<p>

<u><h1 style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #006A71; font-size: 100%"><b>Paling Comel</h1></b></u>
Lagu Paling Comel is a song that my mother used to sing. She would always repeat one line from the song: “bola-bola api.” As a child, of course, I would start to imagine all sorts of things from that line. Because of that, the song has stayed in my memory until now. It’s a simple moment, but one that I’ll never forget.<p>
